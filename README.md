> üöß **Warning**
> This project is in early development, it does however work with real sats! Always use amounts you don't mind losing.

Rewritten wrapper for Lightning Network Daemon in TypeScript based on [LNDHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub).
This is a tribute to the amazing work done by [BlueWallet Team](https://github.com/BlueWallet) with
some creative differences, as followed:

## Creative differences and roadmap

- TypeScript helps the project scale in the long-term.
- Scrap monolithic structure for an easier to track modular one.
- Dependency injection pattern for loose coupling.
- Vite for front-end construction.
- Vitest for API testing and BlueWallet compatibility maintenance.
- Killed Object-Oriented Programming with fire when it came to ORM-like operations. üî•

> üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Pending tasks on the roadmap**

- Pair with crontab for script-running.
- [BlueWallet Acceptance Tests](https://github.com/BlueWallet/LndHub#tests).
- CI/CD: Reject commits which fail BlueWallet Acceptance Tests on `origin/master`.
- Cache solution change: Change [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) solid-state drive caching to [Memcached](memcached.org).
- Create benchmark comparisons to justify `redis` -> `memcached` change.
- Create mock services using `sqlite3` and use them to create integration tests.
- CI/CD: Reject commits which fail integration tests with attached mock services.
- Orchestration: Write `docker-compose.yaml` for [Umbrel App Framework](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps).
- Implement Nostr Wallet Connect [NIP-47](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md) on top of existing authentication.
- Add bounties for above tasks.
