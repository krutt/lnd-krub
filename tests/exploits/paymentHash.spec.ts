/**
 * Dear list,
 *
 * earlier last month, our team at LNbits discovered a rather interesting exploit which wich would
 * enable an attacker to create balances out of thin air by abusing a quirk in how invoices are
 * handled internally. We've patched this in LNbits version 0.10.5 and urge anyone to update ASAP if
 * you haven't done so already. I want to describe the attack here, since my gut feeling is that
 * carrying out the same exploit is possible in other Lightning applications. If you're working on
 * custodial wallets, payment processors, account management software, etc. you probably want to
 * read this.
 *
 * In short, the attacker was able to insert a bolt-11 payment hash of payment A into a different
 * payment, creating a malicious invoice B that can trick the backend into believing that B == A.
 *
 * Here is how it goes:
 *
 * - Attacker creates invoice A of amount 1000 sat in LNbits
 * - Attacker creates invoice B' of amount 1 sat on her own node
 * - Attacker deserializes B', inserts payment_hash(A) into payment_hash(B), re-signs the invoice,
 *   and serializes it again, producing malicious invoice B
 * - Attacker creates a new account in LNbits and pays B
 *
 * - LNbits backend uses payment_hash(B) to check whether this is an internal payment or a payment
 *   via LN
 * - Backend finds A in its database since we implicitly assume that payment_hash(A) commits to A
 *
 * ** This is the critical part! Payment hashes do *NOT* commit to any payment details (like amount)
 * but only to the preimage! **
 *
 * - Backend settles payment internally by crediting A debiting B
 * - Attacker has "created" 999 sats
 *
 * Mitigation:
 *
 * The mitigation is quite simple. Backends should either use self-generated unique "checking id's"
 * for looking up internal payments or use additional checks to make sure that the invoice details
 * have not been messed around with (e.g., asserting amount(A) == amount(B)).
 *
 * Lessons:
 *
 * I think there are two lessons here. First, it's good to realize the level of sophistication of
 * LN-savvy attackers. This attack clearly involves a fundamental understanding of bolt-11 and
 * requires custom tooling to produce the malicious invoice.
 *
 * The second lesson is more valuable: The "payment hash" of an invoice is not a "payment" hash but
 * merely a "preimage" hash – and nothing else. Naming this field as such increases the chance of
 * developers implicitly assuming that the hash commits to payment details like amount, pubkey, etc.
 * I will from now on call this simply the "preimage hash" and invite you to do so too.
 *
 * Best
 * Calle
